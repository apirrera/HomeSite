            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3>Aspiring Software Engineer</h3>

            <hr>
            <p>In my previous professional life, I've always had an interest in technology and art. I had liked drawing from an early age and took art classes in college. I was in the IT sector as a Desktop Support Analyst. My favorite parts of my career
                were solving problems and interacting with people to find solutions. The two things had been separate planes for me. I realized there could be an intersection between my current career and my hobby, the middle plane between art and technology.
                I started to learn UX design and as well as the process to create it. I want to be able to create websites and phone applications that I've designed.
                <br> I consider the values of consistency to be the most important. It's okay to fail and be disappointed that a vision doesn't match skill level, but it's best to enjoy the journey and any 1 centimeter of improvement. It's that repeated
                effort that's the most valuable. It's also best to only compare yourself to your past self. It's about beating the past you.
                <br> In the future, I want to create something meaningful in the world. I want to improve my digital art skills and programming ability. I want to use my art and technology skills to create a wonderful intersection.
            </p>
